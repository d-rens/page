I'm daniel, I'm from Germany and studying what I want to study at the time, mainly CS, maths, literature and philosophy.

On the [blog](/blog) I keep track of the bigger projects I've done or the bigger thoughts I have, to be able to inspire people or at least get told ways to do something better :).

I spend too much on my time on configuring and figuring Linux, you can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/d-rens/dotfiles) and the programs I use [here](/programs).
