5/5

Less ideology based than I expected it. Much more based on history and contemporary proceedings instead. It having 8 prefaces is also interesting, Marx and Engels added onto it while things related happened e.g. the actions of the Paris Commune 1871. When Marx died Engels continued to write those.
