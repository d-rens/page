5/5

Refreshingly different read, the book is made out of six diaries of the protagonist "Stiller" and one of his prosecutor which became friends over the period of his condemnation.

Stiller does not think he is the Swiss Stiller, but an American citizen instead.
During his diaries he finds out about Stiller while beliefing that is a totally foreign guy to him.
