3/5

Expected way lots of new things in this marxist read, but it ended up being Marx and Engels recited and corrected after the 50 years between those's main period.

It was nothing very impressive, he basically said "oh but recently that happened, marx said that wouldnt happen decades ago".

And the last third he starts rambling about his own theory about revolution.
Disappointed with this one.
