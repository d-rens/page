5/5

Certainly one of the most interesting books I've read lately. It's an issue I fortunately have no experience with but felt the urge to know more about. The author tries to make clear, once the stigma on mental illness and as a colloraly suicide is not as bad anymore in society, then life would be a lot better for those in need.

It is not a problem such as a lethal illness, there is help. And if society gets educated on it then we are able to help those in need and stop the current suicide epidemic.
