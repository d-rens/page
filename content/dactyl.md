# The Dactyl Experience

## Preface 
A Dactyl (or Dactyl Manuform in my case) is a parametric generated keyboard
with the following ergonomic features to make it great to use:

**Split**
: Allows one to keep the hands on sholderwidth which makes it convenient to use
over a longer timespan.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Staggered Columns**
: If you look at your keyboard the rows are most likely staggered, if you then
look at your hands you see they are indeed not staggered horizontally but
vertically. For clarification, there was a use for the staggered rows back in
the ages of typewriters due to how they were constructed, but now many decades
later we still carry the technical dept around with us [^1] *(that's like if one were
to use windows).* 




[^1]: One could argue here that a layout change from qwerty/qwertz to something
    like dvorak would solve another huge issue with typewriters. Yes, expect a
    post on this the next weeks. This will probably be the next post.
