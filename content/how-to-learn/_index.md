Here I'll write articles about things I've spend a of lot time on. The goal is to
help you - the interested reader - with my now aquired knowledge to make it an easier and
even more fun process.

For now these are the things I'm planning to write a guide on.
- LaTeX
- Neovim

The Guides will have many resources like videos, blogposts, etc. of others that
helped me to learn it, compiled into a list. To first peak your interest and
then give an guide, in depth enough to give you an kickstart from there to dive
into more.

# LaTeX


# Vim/Neovim
