        <h3>Priorities</h3>
        <p>I don't have too harsh priorities, I try my best to not use bloat,
        but I am also not far enough into it, and wasting time to be a 
        <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> extremist. It'll probably 
        become better in the future, but for now i use rather simple and easy programs. <br>
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/d.rens/dotfiles">Here </a>you can find my dotfiles for configs and scripts.</p>

          <dt>Operating System</dt>
          <dd>I use Arch linux, just works, from time to time at least.</dd>

          <dt>Terminal</dt>
          <dd>I use Alacritty, i don't have any specific reasons for it, but it just works
          and is costumizable nicely.</dd>

          <dt>Texteditor</dt>
          <dd>Neovim with lua config, mostly out of a primagen tutorial.</dd>
          
          <dt>Window Manager</dt>
          <dd>Bspwm, with Sxhkd as hotkey deamon, it's nice.</dd>

          <dt>File manager</dt>
          <dd>ranger, also need to work on that, it's too heavy python.</dd>
