        <h3>Priorities</h3>
        <p>I don't have too harsh priorities, I try my best to not use bloat,
        but I am also not far enough into it, and wasting time to be a 
        <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> extremist. It'll probably 
        become better in the future, but for now i use rather simple and easy programs. <br>
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/d.rens/dotfiles">Here </a>you can find my dotfiles for configs and scripts.</p>


        <dl>
          <dt>Operating System</dt>
          <dd>I use a minimalist <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi
              Linux</a>, which is the Arm Archlinux but on a Apple Silicon M1.<br>
            I use it since some weeks, and am very happy with it, can't report
            any errors, except maybe that i can't change the brightness because
            the drivers are not working yet.
          </dd>

          <dt>Terminal</dt>
          <dd>I use Alacritty, i don't have any specific reasons for it, but it just works
          and is costumizable nicely.</dd>

          <dt>Texteditor</dt>
          <dd>Heavily bloated neovim. It's not bad, certainly the best I've used yet, 
          but I am not happy with the config I have for it, because there is way more 
          than I need.</dd>
          
          <dt>Window Manager</dt>
          <dd>Bspwm, with Sxhkd as hotkey deamon, I love it, but probably that's just 
          because I have not experienced dmw yet.</dd>

          <dt>File manager</dt>
          <dd>ranger, also need to work on that, it's too heavy python.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Writing Documents</h3>
        <p>Writing documents is the favourite thing I do on the operating
        system, and also the best I have used.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>LaTeX</dt>
          <dd>I mainly use LaTeX in neovim, because it just looks great, i want to get
            many as possible into using it, because for me it made writing
            documents much better and the output looks great. <br>
            <i>Am at the moment writing a german 
              <a href="https://gitlab.com/d.rens/docs/-/blob/main/LaTeX/tutorial/tutorial.pdf">guide to LaTeX</a>,
              so if interested feel free to check it out.</i>
          </dd>

          <dt>markdown</dt>
          <dd>rarely I also use markdown for simple documents, but then with Pandoc to compile 
          documents with LaTeX backend so it still looks good and i can use e.g. some packages.</dd>

          <dt>pdf viewer</dt>
          <dd>zathura, oh it's great, maybe the perfect programm.</dd>

          <dt>image viewer:</dt>
          <dd>sxiv</dd>

          <dt>image modification</dt>
          <dd>Affinity serif suite <i>not on Linux :,(</i></dd>
