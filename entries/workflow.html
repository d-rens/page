            <h2>goals of the setup</h2>
            <p>The goal of the workflow is to be ever evolving to be more efficient and useful. The main application is to write LaTeX,
            manage references, figures, etc. So that one does not need to think about it anymore but has a good experience using it
            and optimal output.</p>


            <h3>LaTeX</h3>
            <p>LaTeX is a typesetting software that makes digital typesetting easy and
            visually appealing. However, there is a little entry barrier because you need
            to know commands to use it. Nevertheless, everything is generally logical and
            makes sense.</p>

            <p>Personally, I have a lot of fun using it, and it often motivates me to get work
            done instead of being a hindrance like Word. I don't want to focus solely on
            why Word is bad, but here's a nice way to compare them: In Word, you set your
            text while typing, and you only see the 'finished' text. Consequently, while
            writing, you might do it naturally or, to procrastinate, start to format
            everything. Then, when you move a figure, there is the possibility that
            everything gets messed up. </p>

            <p>On the other hand, with LaTeX, you just write in plain text using, for example,
            Vim (which also makes it more enjoyable to use). You see the text with commands
            within it, and you focus on writing content without worrying about how it
            looks. When you want to add a footnote, you simply use '\footnote{}' and input
            the content. There are no style considerations to think about, but it still
            yields a sense of logical structure, resulting in the best and most perfect
            outcome from my experience. </p>

            <p>Another thing, things like bibliographies are made nearly automatically, I
            luckily have never written a bibliography myself, but seeing people actually
            doing it, or 'just' copying it from somewhere for every single citation they
            have seems most horrible.</p>



            <h4> Inkscape</h4>
            <p>Inkscape is a vector tool used for creating and editing vector graphics. I use
            it with LaTeX to make some of my mathematical figures. It's open-source,
            which is appealing, and it's also extensible. As extensions, I use a figure
            manager that seamlessly integrates with LaTeX without any extra thinking.
            Additionally, I use a shortcut manager that allows me to have different stroke
            strengths, fill colors, arrow endings, etc., readily available with just a
            keystroke in the app. This convenience reduces the need for excessive mouse
            usage.</p>

            <h3>Neovim</h3>
            <p>Neovim is my text editor of choice for several reasons:</p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li> Firstly, it's more extensible and easier to understand than Vim (for this article: vim = neovim). </li>
                <li> Secondly, Vim is highly efficient once you learn it. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Vim maps every letter on the keyboard, and while non-/ and capitalized
            letters require certain keys to enter insert mode for writing text, as long
            as you are not in insert mode, you can navigate and edit a text file or
            document using the entire keyboard. This allows for faster editing compared
            to any other text editor. Admittedly, it takes some time to get used to, but
            the skills I've gained from learning Vim have been tremendously beneficial,
            as mentioned in the LaTeX section.</p>
            <p> It's a lot of fun to use.</p>


            <h3>Zotero</h3>
            <p>Zotero is one of the programs I enjoy less due to its heavy GUI-based nature.
            However, its convenience makes me continue using it, which speaks highly of its
            usefulness. </p>

            <p>Zotero is a reference management software used to gather references such as
            papers, articles, books, etc., for academic research. It allows users to view,
            annotate, export bibliography citations, and perform other functions. </p>

            <p>Personally, I use Zotero for three main purposes:
            <ul>
                <li> Using the browser extension to add sources with just one click. </li>
                <li> Automatically writing all citations into a .bib file every two seconds for BibLaTeX to use. </li>
                <li> Being able to cite these sources in LaTeX without any problems or hassle. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <h3>Obsidian</h3>
            <p>Lastly, I use Obsidian because I did not have a good system to take care of my
            plain-text notes. Obsidian seems to be a good alternative. </p>

            <p>But I do use it fully in Neovim with a plugin, so it is enjoyable to use. Here
            are some features which I enjoy:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>  Write everything in markdown. </li>
                <li>  Have automatically daily notes (accessible with a hotkey in my config). </li>
                <li>  Reference different notes. </li>
                <li>  Show a graph to display links between notes. </li>
                <li>  Use templates. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            There is one initial problem I have with the setup, which is the setup is perfectly optimized to write papers and do
            reasearch, but at the moment I have as good as nothing to do with that. </p>

            <p>
            This is the taking notes part of the setup, later in Part 2 I'll talk abuot the bigger system: tiling window manager,
            hotkey deamon, etc. </p>
