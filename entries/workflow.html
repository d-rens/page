            <h2>preface</h2>

            First of all, my workflow is aimed towards doing maths, and only maths basically. I have a bunch of other subjects, but
            they either not ought to be noted due to being useless, or are basically the same as math, just with some
            real-life-applications, as physics.<br>

            <br>
            So one could say it's to write LaTeX. <br>
            <br>

            <h2>OS, programs, and everything else</h2>

            Around three months ago I haven't used any of those mentioned, and there are some good reasons why I sticked to them,
            even though they required more learning then common programs, but simple enough to get the basics down in a week or so. <br>
            <br>
            The main programs I use are:           
            <h3>neovim</h3>
            As texteditor, those are my plugins:
            <ul>
                <li>Packer as plugin manager </li>
                <li>telescope as fuzzyfinder </li>
                <li>bufferline to view buffers </li>
                <li>tokyonight as theme </li>
                <li>colorizor to see the color on hex codes  </li>
                <li>catppuccin for when i need a light theme  </li>
                <li>lualine as statusline  </li>
                <li>web-devicons for lualine/icons in general  </li>
                <li>codeium as ai autocompletion  </li>
                <li>treesitter as syntax highlighting  </li>
                <li>hapoon to switch files blazingly fast  </li>
                <li>undotree to never use it </li>
                <li>fugitive for git  </li>
                <li>vimtex for latex compilation </li>
                <li>ultisnips mainly for latex snippets  </li>
                <li>lsp things (lspzero, mason, mason-lspconfig, cpm-buffer, nvim-cmp, cmp_luasnip ... </li>
                <li>luasnip  </li>
                <li>friendly-snippets  </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>bspwm with sxhkd </h3>
            These are window manager and hotkey daemon. <br>
            Bspwm makes me 9 + 1 desktops, 9 on the laptop screen + 1 when a monitor is connected. <br>
            Sxhkd makes it very easy to manage hotkeys, for the window manager, note taking scripts, opening apps, using rofi...


            <h3>zotero</h3>
            Zotero as citation manager.<br>
            Addons I use are: Betterbibtex so it keeps an up to date .bib bibliography ready to use for latex, and also something to make the app dark.



            <h3>misc </h3>
            <!--<dl>
            <dt>neovim</dt>
            <dd>Text editor, a vim fork, more extensible.</dd>

            <dt>inkscape</dt>
            <dd>Vector drawing program. Using with an 
            <a href="https://github.com/d-rens/inkscape-shortcut-manager">inkscape shortcut</a> and 
            <a href="https://github.com/d-rens/inkscape-figures">figure manager</a>, which i forked of Giles Castel.</dd>

            <dt>zathura</dt>
            <dd>pdf viewer just works, and has vim like keybindings</dd>
            </dl>-->
            <br>

            All those I am using on Archlinux with bspwm as window manager and sxhkd as hotkey daemon. <br>
            Due to the programs and operating system it is most efficient, not needing a mouse other than to sometimes draw a figure.
            <br>
            For certain projects I am also required to use the 
            <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/">Affinity Suite</a>
            or SolidWorks, for those I then use either MacOS or windows. 
            On other computers either for processing power on a windows tower or the 
            display on a macbook for color accuracy.
            <br>
            Both of those should also be able to be virtualized, but the advantages of the other 
            computers are too good to consider that at the moment for me.
