            <h2>preface</h2>

            First of all, my workflow is aimed towards doing maths, and only maths basically. I have a bunch of other subjects, but
            they either not ought to be noted due to being useless, or are basically the same as math, just with some
            real-life-applications, as physics.<br>

            <br>
            So one could say it's to write LaTeX. <br>
            <br>

            <h2>OS, programs, and everything else</h2>

            Around three months ago I haven't used any of those mentioned, and there are some good reasons why I sticked to them,
            even though they required more learning then common programs, but simple enough to get the basics down in a week or so. <br>
            <br>
            The main programs I use are:           
            <dl>
                <dt>neovim</dt>
                <dd>Text editor, a fork of vim, just more modern, and mainly more extensible.</dd>

                <dt>inkscape</dt>
                <dd>Vector drawing program. Using with an 
                    <a href="https://github.com/d-rens/inkscape-shortcut-manager">inkscape shortcut</a> and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/d-rens/inkscape-figures">figure manager</a>, which i forked of Giles Castel.</dd>

                <dt>zathura</dt>
                <dd>pdf viewer just works, and has vim like keybindings</dd>
                </ul>
                <br>

                All those I am using on Archlinux with bspwm as window manager and sxhkd as hotkey daemon. <br>
                Due to the programs and operating system it is most efficient, not needing a mouse other than to sometimes draw a figure.
                <br>
                For certain projects I am also required to use the 
                <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/">Affinity Suite</a>,
                or SolidWorks, for those I then use either MacOS or windows. 
                On other computers either for processing power on a windows tower or the 
                display on a macbook for color accuracy.
                <br>
                Both of those should also be able to be virtualized, but the advantages of the other 
                computers are too good to consider that at the moment for me.
