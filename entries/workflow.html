          <h2>preface</h2>

          First of all, my workflow is aimed towards doing maths, and only maths basically. I have a bunch of other subjects, but
          they either not ought to be noted due to being useless, or are basically the same as math, just with some
          real-life-applications, as e.g. physics.<br>

          <br>
          So one could say it's to write LaTeX, which is used for maths, that makes more sense. <br>
          <br>

          <h2>OS, programs, and everything else</h2>

          Around three months ago I haven't used any of those mentioned, and there are some good reasons why I sticked to them,
          even though they required more learning then common programs, but simple enough to get the basics down in a week or so. <br>
          <br>
           The main programs I use are neovim, inkscape and zathura. Neovim being the text-editor, inkscape the vektor drawing
           program for figures and zathura just the pdf-viewer to look at the outcome. <br>
           All those I am using on Asahi linux (arm arch on m1) with bspwm as window manager and sxhkd as hotkey daemon. <br>
           This config together with neovim and programs with vim-like keybindings as zathura make working a lot more efficient due
           to not needing a mouse to be operated.<br>
