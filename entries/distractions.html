            As I am sitting here and writing this I am mad with myself. <br>
            It is a Thursday summer night and the day nearly over. <br>
            The problem I face that I have wasted nearly the entire day, as it so often happens.<br>

            And due to what that is, you might ask, it is simple. It is purely the distractions around me. A lot of people don not care
            about their time, are on social media all day, and just live life as most passively as possible. I was like that too,
            when I was a chlid very few years ago. But now I changed my way of thinking, so that every minute not used productively
            is a bad one. I am not on social media anymore, I am most aware of the risks of algoritmically led gratification so to
            say. But still I am browsing reddit, youtube, discord servers many hours a day, without it seeming to get better, and
            even less without a reason behind it.
            <br>
            I have addons on firefox to not show me a youtube feed anymore so I can not browse, so I search useless videos instead and
            watch them then. It has helped, but not as much as I has hoped it would.
            <br>
            Another thing I did was deleting all social media accounts, but I still browse reddit, now just without an account. There seems
            to be no way to escape.
            <br>
            Obviously there are ways to escape, it is as easy as just not opening a website. But on the other hand there is this primal
            instinct to get this gratification as minor as it may be, out of pure convenience. It is a horrible thing, it really does 
            not benefit oneself, but so many (obvs. including me) are still doing it.
            <br>
            One reason I write this is the look the problem straight in the eye, to not get around it anymore, constantly making
            myself think about it, until I actually get it done.

            <br>

            <i>So what are some things I want to do now so it works?</i>

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>As already said, I think there is no way to escape it easily, but first of all being strict with oneself is always
                    an option, if it would just work at least. </li>
                <li>Using more devices that are less likely to distract. That would basically mean no device with internet access.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
