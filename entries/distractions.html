            <p><i> see this as a draft, there is a lot that needs to be added, i'll make it nicely written on the end</i></p>

            <br>

            <p>
            As I am sitting here and writing this I am angering about myself. <br>
            It is a Thursday summer night and the day nearly over. <br>
            The problem I face is that I have wasted nearly the entire day, as it so commonly occurs.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
            And due to what that is, is simple. It is purely the distractions around me. A lot of people do not care
            about their time, are on social media all day, and just live life as most passively as possible. I was like that too,
            when I was a chlid very few years ago. But now I changed my way of thinking, so that every minute not used productively
            is a bad one. I am not on social media anymore, I am most aware of the risks of algoritmically led gratification so to
            say. But still I am browsing reddit, youtube, discord servers many hours a day, without it seeming to get better, and
            even less without a reason behind it. 
            </p>

            <p>
            This is why I am writing this. I want to structure my way of thinking about it. Find solutions, and talk about it
            with others, for the general good of all that participate in the discussion or just in the thinking for themselves.
            </p>


            <p>
            Obviously there are ways to escape, it is as easy as just not opening a website. But on the other hand there is the primal
            instinct to get this gratification as minor as it may be, out of pure convenience. It is a horrible thing, it really does 
            not benefit oneself, but so many (obvs. including me) are still addicted to it.
            </p>


            <p>
            <i>So what are some things I want to do now so it works?</i>
            </p>

            <p> <s> <ul>
                        <li>As already said, I think there is no way to escape it easily, but first of all being strict with oneself is always
                            an option, if it would just work at least. 
                        </li> 
                </s>
                        <li>Using more devices that are less likely to distract. That would basically mean no device with internet access.</li>
                        <li>configuring for minimalism</li>
                        <li>continuing on the account deleting spree</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>It seems like a good idea is to minimalize everything, I have not come around yet to read Cal Newports digial
                minimalism, I guess that would help, but for now I will just think for myself. </p>
            <p>So what I am on doing now is the following, I'll split it into the devices.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>phone</dt>
                <dd>- deleting apps, basically everything that isn't required 100%</dd>
                <dd>- adding filters, so making all to greyscale, then to warm light. </dd>
                <dd>- black wallpaper, switching lockscreen time to a things i can't read</dd>

                <dt>linux</dt>
                <dd>- Here it is harder, i'll try to find very minimalistic neovim colors cause that's annoying me right now</dd>
                <dd>- a whole lot of firefox addons, also changing to qute for main browser</dd>
                <dd>- black wallpaper</dd>
                <dd>- probably switching to st and make it minimalistic</dd>

                <dt>macos</dt>
                <dd>- same filters as on phone </dd>
                <dd>- black wallpaper</dd>
                <dd>- same browser addons as on linux</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
            Next to the device restrictions I started to act more on I also spoke with some friends about this entry here.<br>
            The goal is to not waste any time, this is a vague thing to say and can be interpreted different by different people, so
            let me get it clearer in a table:
            </p>
            <br>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Useful</th>
                        <th>Not Useful</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>resting</td>
                    <td>scrolling without reason</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>reading</td>
                    <td>social media (discord, reddit... included)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>socializing</td>
                    <td>watching videos you didn't intend to watch</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>working</td>
                    <td>sometimes chatting</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>learning</td>
                    <td>gaming</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>configuring </td>
                    <td>consuming</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
            You probably get the point, it's not about working 24h a day, it's about not wasting any time.<br>
            So resting/sleeping is a perfect use for time, the goal is just to prevent wasting time on stuff you dont even want to do yourself.
            </p>
